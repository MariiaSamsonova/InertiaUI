# InertiaUI
A game called "Inertia". 
A game on a cellular field. The player can move only by inertia (to the stopping cell or to the wall) and only after that you can choose a new direction of movement. It is necessary to collect all the prizes to win. There are traps that make the game more difficult.
The player has 3 lives. After hitting a cell with a trap, the number of lives decreases by 1. When the number of lives becomes zero, the game ends in defeat.
The user has the opportunity to choose of three different levels of the game, see the time for which the level was passed, as well as the number of lives of the player remaining.

Elements of the playing field:
â˜º - player (main actor)
@ - prizes
* - stop cell on which the player can stop the movement
# - wall (an impassable obstacle, the player cannot step on this cell, the edge of the playing field is also a wall)
% is a trap

In the future, the game may be improved by adding new levels, improving the user interface, and adding new gameplay elements.

Inertia is a portable game, so no installation is required. The program is launched by opening the InertiaUI.exe file.
